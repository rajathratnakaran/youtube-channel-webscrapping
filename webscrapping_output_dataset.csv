Also side not not mentioned in the video: I think a lot of us forget that 1280x720 on a 4.7"" display is still really quite sharp (300+ ppi), and the average consumer won't see a difference in sharpness between this and the HTC One, for example. It'll be more about colors and saturation. And this is an OLED display so colors will pop more and appear brighter to the average shopper holding them side by side in store. Crazy, right?

Here's what Apple sued for, word-for-word:

 • A rectangular product shape with all four corners uniformly rounded;
 • the front surface of the product dominated by a screen surface with black borders;
 • as to the iPhone and iPod touch products, substantial black borders above and below the screen having roughly equal width and narrower black borders on either side of the screen having roughly equal width;
 • a display of a grid of colorful square icons with uniformly rounded corners; and
 • a bottom row of square icons (the ""Springboard"") set off from the other icons and that do not change as the other pages of the user interface are viewed.

What do you want to see in the iPad 3? And WHY?

In case you were curious about the math:

1,024 x 768 = 786,432

First impressions of the hardware a pretty solid. I like the fluidity of the 24"" slider for such a low budget item and I've been impressed with the build quality so far. Watching review of the slider doesn't really give a good impression of the weight, but with a DSLR or heavier camera the IndiSlider handles friction with the rails very well. This allows for nice, fluid reveal shots and slider motions during videos. OVerall it's an excellent product at an excellent price.

1125,Don't buy the Verizon iPhone 4 [Yet],2011-01-11 23:59:35+00:00,"Top reasons NOT to buy the Verizon iPhone 4!

We all can be fairly confident that Apple will continue its annual product release schedule and unveil a Verizon LTE-based 4G iPhone 5 this summer and likely piss off millions of former AT&T customers.

Verizon peeps - I know how you feel! You've been waiting for years. A few more months can't hurt much. Let the iPhone 5 rumors begin!

iPhone 5 on Verizon LTE solves:
~ Nominal speed difference between AT&T vs Verizon
~ No Voice and Data at the same time on 3G
~ Pissed off early adopters of VZW iPhone 4

Experience high definition sound while on the move with these ultra light and comfortable on-ear headphones. Advanced proprietary titanium coated driver technology ensures they preserve every bit of the lush bass, vital details and high energy your favorite artists created for their fans. Plus, the ingenious tri-fold design makes for easy storage when not in use. Solo HD's cable also features Monster ControlTalk for iPod playback control and iPhone, iPods, and iPad. Pardon the cameo by the Zune HD in the video, as ControTalk does not actually work with this device.

1179,HD Tutorial: Safari 5,2010-06-08 00:47:25+00:00,"In this tutorial, I show you how and where to get the Safari 5 Final Build from Apple, as it is being officially rolled out today!! There are a number of noteable changes to Safari 5, including the layout, which I can compare to Google Chrome [Safari 4 vs Google Chrome Coming Soon?] So enjoy this tutorial and enjoy the fastest web browser for Windows!

By the way, I performed the Acid3 test on the Safari 4 Beta - a procedure neccesary for every web browser! It scored a perfect 100/100 on the test on it's first try, proving that Apple really did make some webkit changes in Safari 5!

Also, this browser is VERY FAST!

This solves the problem of how to get the progress bar back in Safari. They've brought it back by itself!

Here I review the wireless, flexible, multimedia enabled keyboard kindly sent out to me by the kind folks at DSI.

My First Impressions: It's surprisingly thin! Thin enough that it can be wrapped up and shipped in a TUBE, not a box. Very nice! It's going to be nice traveling with this, as it has little/no weight and can be fitted quite easily into a laptop bag. Can't wait to review this in 1-3 weeks!

Final Review: The folding keyboard from DS International is a revolutionary idea. A keyboard that is not only spill proof and easy to type on - but can also FOLD up to be put anywhere from your pocket, to a briefcase, or a drawer. Perfect for people on the go! One common misconception is that the keyboard will not be sturdy, and could rip. It is actually made of a waterproof material that can be completely submerged for cleaning, and even used underwater. This material will not rip!

Final Grade: 8/10

Reccomended for: Travelers, Netbook users

In the Box:

iSkin Headphones
USB Charging Cable
User's Guide
TX (Bluetooth Adapter)
USB -- TX Adapter
Extra Earbud Rubber Tips

First Impressions:

The packaging, first of all, is very clean. Certain companies (Like Apple, Sony) spend a lot of time with their packaging, and it definiteily pays off in the first impressions. The headset itself is very very light, but it still has enough mass to it that it won't fall out of your ears!

Overall, looks like a great device, and I can't wait to review it for you guys!

Here I give my review and final analysis of the iFrogz Earpollutin Custom Fallouts kindly send out to me by the awesome people at iFrogz!

Pros: These headphones are loud, crisp, and very comfortable over the ear. It doesn't say they're noise isolating, but I feel like they are with the amount of foam surrounding your ear and the placement of the drivers. These style headphones are also quite a bit louder and more sensitive than in-ear earbuds.

Cons: Not nearly as portable as any other headphones.

Also: Adjustable and customizeable!

1268,Reviewed: Griffin Elevator [HD],2009-06-26 14:59:45+00:00,"***WATCH IN HD***

Here I'm reviewing the Griffin Elevator Laptop Stand kindly sent out to me by Griffin Technology.

The stand is made of a brushed aluminum, and has rubberized pads on the top and bottom to prevent sliding. They work perfectly. The stand was actually able to support not just a MacBook Air (as shown on the box) but will also work for a medium-weight 15"" Sony Vaio, as well as a beefed-out 17"" HP Pavilion. It's really really sturdy.

The fact that it's so far off of the ground provides 2 major pros: Airflow is number two... Minor cooling is provided because the air is flowing through the bottom of the stand, between the laptop and the desk. The number one pro is the fact that it's elevated up to the same height as a monitor, which provides a great viewing angle for someone who uses their laptop a lot.

This is best used if you have a laptop with an external keyboard, mouse and monitor!

Youtube is now allowing any and every user to download all of their own videos, no matter what format they were uploaded in. They will be downloaded in a Low Quality .mp4 format, which means you'll need Quicktime Player in order to view them.

The upside of this is that is saves your title for you. But the downside is the unusually bad quality. Either way, it's fast, convenient, and compressed and works perfectly!

Guys, These headphones have been absoultely awesome, and a pleasure to unbox. In the box, you get not only the headphones, but you get the over-ear plastic pieces, three different silicone in-ear buds, and the filter changing tool as well as a number of different filters that will be covered in the review video.

First Impressions: I love that they come with a lost more than just the headphones themselves. That is an admirable touch. They're packaged nicely, and the headphones have a very clean, glossy look that is attractive from the start. I can't wait to review these for you guys in 1-3 weeks. Stay tuned!

Here's an unboxing video for you guys, of the Sena Cases Ultraslim Leather Pouch for the LG Voyager.

First impressions: It's definitely real leather (it passes my super-scientific smell-test). It's a nice looking pouch, and even comes with a larger, softer pouch for travel. I really like companies who include more than just the product - And Sena Cases is nice enough to send a travel pouch for your LG VX10000 case!

Here I review the DSI Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard, kindly sent out to me by the kind folks at DS International.

It is a very lightweight, slim keyboard, but takes very little getting used to. The keyboard has a small amount of travel, and sounds nice when typing. I liked the integrated touchpad - a nice touch, so an out-of-battery mouse is never a real problem. It's so thin that it's space-saving, and it also has a TON of hotkeys and special function keys for easy access to those often hidden features of Windows.

The mini usb receiver travels up to 10 feet, and runs at a 2.4 GHz frequency. Being wireless was never a problem, like it is for some keyboards and mice.

I know the lighting's not so good, but I'm new to this :)

Here's my final impressions and review video of the SOLO 17"" Laptop Messenger Bag kindly sent out to me by the nice folks at SOLO.

I was actually able to use the bag twice in order to conduct this review. It's a really full-featured bag, and the main 17"" sleeve for the laptop is well-padded, and is fastened shut with velcro. The bag comes with a nice, large, adjustable shoulder strap with a non-skid padding, and it's comfy enough to carry a heavy laptop in for a long period of time.

The organizer and accessory pockets under the front flap are well-placed and there was just something about the zippered pocket that was just SO well designed, it kept everything compact without squishing everything. It's brilliantly made!

Laptop Pocket Size:
16 x 11 x 2 in. / 40.6 x 27.9 x 5.1 cm

Dimensions:

Here I unbox the Griffin Elevator Laptop Stand kindly sent out to me by the kind folks at Griffin Technologies!

First Impressions: This stand is very simple, and of a sturdy build quality. It's made of a nice metal, and it seems to grip the table nicely. It was easy to set up, and as you saw in the video, it took less than 15 seconds to make it work! I'm looking forward to using this for a few, and I should have a full review video in 1-2 weeks!

Here is my overall review and final impressions video of the USB 2.0 Keyboard with Hub and Dock kindly sent out to me by Matias.

It's a decent keyboard. It has a very soft feel, sturdy build, and although it isn't jam-packed with unique features, it has a few things that are unique about it that separate it from the rest of the keyboards in this price range.

A Tab key on the number pad allows one-handed number entry into forms and spreadsheets, leaving your other hand free to hold or flip through information being entered.

The USB 2.0 Keyboard has two USB plugs - One connects the Keyboard and USB 1.1 hub to your computer, and the second connects the USB 2.0 Dock directly to a USB 2.0 port on your computer, providing full power and speed to the Dock.

Anyway, here is my unboxing and first impressions video of the Fire-i Digital Camera kindly sent out to me by UniBrain. It's a small, lightweight color digital camera that can be used as a webcam. It runs off of a 1394 Firewire cable (6-pin) and is a sliver color on the outside. It also comes with a mini-tripod and a Software CD.

First Impressions: The camera is smaller than it looks in any pictures, and it looks handy that the camera is much more portable because of this. The mini tripod is of solid build, and can even be used for a regular-sized digital camera, and even has telescopic legs!

Blurb from their site:

Earpollution D33 earbuds are not only noise isolating headphones, but also offer a snug secure fit and rich deep sound. Each package includes 3 ear fits and a convenient travel case. The metallic colors and PVC Radioactive patch are stylish and easily recognized as part of the ifrogz family.

Here's the full review video fo the SoundTech GN3 Desktop Microphone from Alto-Edge. The microphone is most impressive because of the fact that it's quality is beautiful! So getting quality power, stereo sound, and bass is definitely a strong point of this microphone.

This review video will be posted as a video response to the unboxing video (as always) so you guys can see exactly what came in the box.

The mic is phantom powered, and has 2 pivot points for easy customization for your setup. I reccomend this microphone for PC recording software, voice recognition software, internet chatting (VOIP or Skype) and other applications along those lines.

The neck is a 16-inch, made of rubber, with 2 pivot points. It is noise cancelling! It comes with a 10-foot stereo 3.5mm plug that plugs into any laptop or desktop's microphone port. The non-skid base is actually weighted, and made of metal, and has a nun-skid rubber bottom to prevent it from sliding.

Power supply: Phantom Power 3V DV

Here is my unboxing and first impressions video of the iFrogz Earpollution D33 Noise Isolating Earbuds. They are a nice black and yellow color, though there are other colors available at their website. You also get different sized earbuds, as well as a carrying case in the package.

First Impressions: The headphones LOOK nice!! I can't wait to try them out, they definitely look high quality, and the shape of them is really low profile, I like that. I love the fact that it comes with a carrying case. Companies that include accessories like this make me proud :)

There's an asymmetrical wiring to it, if you didn't already notice. That means the right earphone swings around the back of your neck conveniently, and I've always liked that feature. It says ""Noise isolating"" all over the box, so I really can't wait to see/hear the quality of these buds!

Here I'll go over a pretty sweet adjustable tilted stand I recieved from HandStands.

It's made of a solid plastic, and has a detachable USB 2.0 hub, and it features a 6-level vertical adjustment!

It provides a nice typing angle at its lowest setting, but any higher and you'll want to use an external keyboard. I'll show you where to adjust the stand in the video - there's a simple knob, and I was impressed at how high the stand could actually go.

There are no fans on this stand, but it does cool your laptop a bit from being off of the ground. Also, the 1-plug USB 2.0 powered hub means you only have to unplug 1 cord to go mobile!

The only cons are the lip that blocks the touchpad and/or headphone and mic jacks, and the fact that you pretty much have to remove the laptop to change the angle.

I'll show you a few basic features, and give you a brief look around the interface.

I highly recommend trying this out!

1312,Unboxed: Adjustable Laptop Stand from HandStands,2009-04-25 04:46:37+00:00,"***WATCH IN HD***

This is the unboxing video of the adjustable laptop stand kindly sent to me by:

http://www.handstands.com/

First impressions: It's made of a really solid plastic, and there's a convenient 4 port usb 2.0 hub on the back (powered). It doesn't look like it's going to break any time soon, but it's not aluminum like a lot of other coolers I've tried (See: NZXT Cryo LX Unboxing).

Overall, this looks like a solid piece of hardware, and I can't wait to get this up and set up running with an external keyboard!

1313,Reviewed: ExtremePDA Case for LG Voyager [HD],2009-04-23 23:03:12+00:00,"***WATCH IN HD***

Here I give my final opinions on the Hard Shell LG Voyager case sent to me by ExtremePDA. It's a nice case, and the real feature of it is its protective outside, and its inside doesn't ever scratch your phone. Although the installation is extremely quick and easy (to throw a case on it in the morning) uninstallation takes upwards of 2-3 minutes, even if you know what you're doing.

The case has a soft matte finish, although it is a hard rubberized case. It's more rugged than it looks. There's no screen protector or MicroFiber included. Overall, the case is very well made, it's not cheaply made at all - it's worth every cent for the protection!

Thanks to ExtremePDA for sending this out to me!

Overall Rating: 8/10

First impressions: If you didn't already notice, I've used this microphone already for 2 tutorials, and I LOVED the quality. This is a plug-and-play microphone, so no extra features are going to need to be installed

The quality of this thing is AMAZING and very crisp and clear so far, although I'm still changing a few settings to get everything perfect.

CCleaner is a freeware system optimization and privacy tool. It removes unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. It also cleans traces of your online activities such as your Internet history. But the best part is that it's fast (normally taking less than a second to run) and contains NO Spyware or Adware!

Comment by http://www.youtube.com/naryanr:

I would add, this program has the tendency to completely screw up google chrome. it did for me. if you are hit, 90% of the pages will display incorrectly and YouTube is rendered useless. uncheck all the boxes under the chrome logo to be safe. uninstalling and reinstalling won't fix it. the pages slowly fix themselves over a number of weeks, i had to wait.

I suggest you gollow his instrutcions (while under the ""cleaner tab"")!

The 20 comes standard with a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB of DDR3 RAM, 320GB hard drive and the new NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card. That setup runs for $1199.00 and its a great deal. Next up is the group of 24s. They all have boosted specs, including faster processor, more RAM standard, bigger hard drives, and much better graphics cards from NVIDIA. Also, the iMac now supports up to 8GB of 1066MHz DDR3 RAM for increasedperformance. One thing that I noticed on the back of the iMac where the ports are located is theabsenceof Firewire 400.first the macbooksnow the iMac. So if your someone who is buying your first Mac and you have a Mini DV camcorder that youve used for family holidays, vacation etc. how will you import your footage? Time to buy a new cable! One last thing about the iMac, it now has 4 USB 2.0 ports rather than 3 and instead of the Mini DVI port, it has a Mini DisplayPort. So that wraps up the iMac.

Here I go over (In 720p High Definition) the newest features presented at http://www.apple.com/mac about the newest version of the (2009) Mac Mini. Watch for new overview of the newest in ports, connectivity, expandability, and hardware upgrades that separate this from the last generation of the Mac Mini!

Starting off with the Mac mini.where do I begin? It was introduced a couple years ago and got an update every so often. It reallydidntreceive much attention. As the introductory level Macintosh, the Mac Mini is the smallest and most affordable Mac computer. There was a lot of talk about Apple discontinuing the Mac Mini, but its not over yet! I was glad to see the Mac Mini get configuration updates and hardware boosts all around. It now comes standard with a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card, superdrive 2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Due processor and 1 GB of RAM and 120GB hard drive on the $599.99 model. Now if your willing to put in another 200 bucks, you can upgrade your memory to 2GB and a 320GB hard drive. There are also some new ports on the back of the machine. It now comes with 5 USB 2.0 ports, Firewire 800 and a Mini DVI and Mini DisplayPort outputs. Since the Mac Mini is powered by a NVIDIA chipset, it now has the capabilities of running dual displays, which I think is awesome for this entry level Mac. Overall, the Mac Mini Upgrade seems awesome and Im glad Apple kept it around.

A note: Firefox preloader (see previous tutorial), Fission, and several addons are still compatible with the newest beta version of Firefox, however, a number of the others, and a few themes i liked were no longer compatible, and were rendered unusable.

Have you noticed a lot of the really good, really popular Youtube channels out there have some kind of Introduction video or closing ""saying?"" Well in this tutorial, I will show you how to make a Youtube Intro, the easy way - just using a couple of pictures you've got on your computer!

1. Go to: http://animoto.com/ like I did in the tutorial - create your video.

2. Hit the ""Export to Youtube"" Button I showed you.

3. Use Youtube Downloader (http://youtubedownload.altervista.org/) to download that short video directly from Youtube - I'm going to do a separate video on Youtube downloader, so stay tuned for that!

4. Once downloaded, use a video editing application (Camtasia Studio, Windows Movie Maker) To cut out the parts you don't like, and eliminate the annoying ""ANIMOTO"" Frame in the last 2 seconds of your video.

5. Now, whenever you want to upload a video, just use either Camtasia Studio or Windows Movie maker (or whatever you want!) To put your intro video you created right in front of your actual Youtube video!

6. Publish that file - and that's what you upload!

You saw it here first  -  this is youtube's first unboxing of this particular product...

World's largest full aluminum laptop cooler:
NZXT Cryo LX!

My first hardware unboxing, but all goes well - all I have to say is this cooler works REALY WELL!!

I give it a 10/10 for cooling (it's freezing cold when fans are on low)
I give it a 6/10 for portabliity (hullo, it's the world's largest! It's meant to stay on ur desk, but it DOES fold)
I give it a 10/10 for design (and I'm crazy bout the USB 2.0 powered hub, as well as the tilt factor and grips!)

I just love this cooler, and I reccomend it to anyone who has a really hot laptop or a 17"" or larger machine! It WILL cool ur XBOX!

Here's a test I did with the temperatures - they're by no means scientific - but it shows a significant temperature diff. between running the laptop on my desk and on the fans - full blast!

All temps are in fahrenheit!

Boot up WITHOUT cooler:

Idle temperatures after 5 minutes:

gpu: 104
core1: 64
core2: 72

Inserted a graphicy (definitely not a word) game and played for 15 minutes:

gpu: 140
core1: 74
core2: 81


WITH NZXT Cryo LX:

Idle temps after 5 minutes:
gpu: 93
core1: 59
core2: 69

Inserted game and played for 15 minutes:

gpu: 124
